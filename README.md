# Shape Calculator

This Java program calculates the area, perimeter, and volume of various shapes. The program is menu-driven, and the user can choose which shape to calculate for.

## Shape Classes

The program includes the following shape classes:
- `Circle`
- `Rectangle`
- `Square`
- `Sphere`
- `Cylinder`
- `Pyramid`

All of these classes extend the `Shape` class, which is an abstract class that defines the `calculatePerimeter` and `calculateArea` methods. The `Cylinder` class also implements the `Volume` interface, which defines the `calculateVolume` method.

## Usage

To use the program, run the `Main` class. This will display a menu of shapes that the user can choose from. Once the user selects a shape, they will be prompted to enter the necessary measurements for that shape (e.g., radius, height, etc.). The program will then calculate and display the area, perimeter, and volume (if applicable) of the selected shape.
